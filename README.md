A simple chemical enrichment for galaxies including stellar population
modelling in a star-by-star fashion. A complimentary semi-analytic model
to an under-development chemical enrichment and individual star model in
the cosmological hydrodynamics code Enzo. Intended use (for now) is to quickly
and cheaply characterize the effect of modifying free parameters in the 
chemical and stellar model without running expensive hydro simulations.
